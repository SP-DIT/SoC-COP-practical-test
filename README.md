# Instructions

Questions are in the individual files:
- q1.js
- q2.js
- q3.js
- etc...

To test your code you can either
1. Use your own test case by modifying the parameters given to the function within the question file, and execute the file (e.g. `node q1.js`)
2. Run the public test cases (e.g. `node ./tests/q1.test.js`)
